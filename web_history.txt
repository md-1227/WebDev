Web 1.0 was the earliest version of the internet. It was primarily static webpages. It had elements from HTML 3.2 like frames an tables. However, it was not possible to take input from an end user. HTML forms were sent by email. Images and GIFs were possible to be displayed. Due to the inability to take user input, this version of the Web is also called the read-only Web.

Web 2.0 was the first major innovation in Web technology as it allowed for user generated content. This is when communities and other social media were mainly formed. Blogs, podcasts, videos mainly started to be produced since this time. Web 2.0 utilizes AJAX and Javascript frameworks. Application Programming Interface, APIs are also used. The content was thus dynamic, changing with user input. So, it was called Participative Social Web.

Web 3.0, or the semantic web, is the the evolution of the internet towards a decentralized, super-intelligent internet. This is done through the use of personalization, blockchain-based decentralization, and artificial intelligence to help users become better at what they do. The main characteristics of this include the use of smart contracts, cryptocurrency integration, and the semantic data organization that allows machines to "understand" content. Platforms such as blockchain (Ethereum, Polkadot), AI frameworks, and decentralized storage systems (IPFS) are the core technologies for Web 3.0.
